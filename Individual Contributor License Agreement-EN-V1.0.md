# Individual Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in the open source projects owned and managed by UnionTech Software.

This Contributor License Agreement ("CLA" or “Agreement”) allows You to contribute to the Projects. In order to clarify the rights granted with Contributions from any person or entity, UnionTech Software must have a CLA on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for Your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of UnionTech Software; it does not change Your rights to use Your own Contributions for any other purpose.

Please read this CLA carefully before completing and signing it, and keep a copy for Your records. By signing this CLA, You understand and agree that the projects and Your contributions to them are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information You submit with them, including Your name and email address) may be maintained in UnionTech Software.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions. Except for the license granted herein to UnionTech Software and recipients of software distributed by UnionTech Software, You reserve all rights, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.
